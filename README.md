## Sentiment Analysis and Trend Visualization in Social Media Data from Twitter using NLP and Machine Learning


# Data Understanding and Preprocessing:

We collected social media data containing text content, sentiment labels, and additional features such as industry classification. After loading the data, we performed preprocessing steps to clean and tokenize the text, remove stopwords, and lemmatize the words. This cleaned and standardized text formed the foundation for our analysis.

# Exploratory Analysis:

To gain initial insights, we conducted exploratory analysis. We visualized the distribution of sentiment classes across different industries, allowing us to identify sectors with more positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. We also created frequency distributions and word clouds to identify frequently occurring terms in different sentiment categories, helping us understand the key topics and themes associated with each sentiment.

# Sentiment Analysis:

Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we performed sentiment analysis on the text data. We used pre-trained sentiment analysis tools to generate sentiment scores, including positive, negative, neutral, and compound scores. These scores allowed us to quantify sentiment intensity and understand the emotional tone of the content.

# Model Building and Evaluation:

I have built a sentiment classification model using a combination of text features and sentiment scores. Also employed a pipeline that integrated TF-IDF vectorization for text features and Standard Scaling for sentiment scores.
